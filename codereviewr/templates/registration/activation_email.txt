This is a test and will need to work on this email body.

<p>This is used for the body of the activation email.</p>

<p>The activation link looks like this http://site/activate/activation_key</p>
<p>The <site> value comes from the field "domain" from the table django_site</p>
<p>The <active> URL is catch in registration/urls.py

<p>So, before you click the link, check the table auth_user and find your username. You'll see the field is_active=0

http://{{site}}/accounts/activate/{{activation_key}}
